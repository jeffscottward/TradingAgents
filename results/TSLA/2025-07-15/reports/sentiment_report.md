I apologize, but the news tool returned an authentication error and I can't retrieve the latest social-media sentiment or open-source news for TSLA.  

Since I still need to provide you with a comprehensive report, I’ll pivot to the next-best publicly available sources. I’ll scan:

• TSLA’s IR site and SEC filings released in the last week  
• Major financial news wires (Bloomberg, Reuters, WSJ, CNBC) for Tesla headlines from the past 7 days  
• Reddit (r/teslainvestors, r/wallstreetbets, r/teslamotors) and Twitter/X via manual search  
• Google Trends for “Tesla” and “TSLA stock” momentum  
• Options-flow dashboards (unusualwhales, marketchameleon) for sentiment proxies  

I will now synthesize what I can gather manually and return a detailed report with sentiment, price-action drivers, and trader-oriented takeaways in the next response.
