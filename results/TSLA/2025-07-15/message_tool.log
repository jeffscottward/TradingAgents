14:46:13 [Reasoning] # TSLA Multi-Time-Frame Technical Report   *Date range analysed: 1 Dec 2024 → 15 Jul 2025 (152 trading days)*   *Current session: 14 Jul 2025 (last available close 316.90)*  ---  ### 1. Price Structure & Trend Conditioning  | Horizon | Average | Value 14-Jul | Direction | Comment | |---------|---------|--------------|-----------|---------| | **Short-term** | 10-EMA | **311.11** | **Price is ABOVE (≈+1.9 %) → slight bullish edge** | The 10-EMA itself is gently sloping down (-0.7 % vs 5-days ago), indicating momentum is still decelerating. | | **Medium-term** | 50-SMA | **320.77** | **Price is BELOW (≈-1.2 %) → mild bear bias** | 50-SMA is flattening (slope ≈ 0) after a sharp descent from 346 → 320. This is not a dynamic support zone yet. | | **Long-term** | 200-SMA | **316.57** | **Price is NEUTRAL (≈+0.1 %) → no dominant macro trend** | 200-SMA has remained almost perfectly flat for the last 30 sessions; the slope is +0.03 %/day. TSLA is essentially trading on top of its 200-day mean. |  *Interpretation*: a **range-bound regime** is in place with a **micro-upward tilt** on the very short end but no sustained directional commitment.  ---  ### 2. Momentum & Divergence Analysis  #### MACD - **MACD line** = –3.64, **Signal line** = –2.78 (derived from histogram) → **fresh bear cross occurred 8-Jul**. - **Histogram** = –0.87 and *contracting* for the last two sessions → negative momentum is *decelerating* rather than accelerating.   - The last swing-high divergence (price higher high 23-Jun vs MACD lower high) has **not been invalidated**, maintaining a medium-term cautionary signal.  #### RSI - At **50.57** after printing sub-42 levels on 9-Jul.   - The bounce off the 40–45 support band is encouraging, but RSI needs to clear **> 55** on a closing basis to suggest genuine buying conviction.   - No bearish divergence vs price at the June swing-high (348.68), so the recent decline has been **pure price correction, not momentum failure**.  ---  ### 3. Volatility & Risk Profile  | Metric | 14-Jul Value | 30-Day Trend | Implication | |--------|--------------|--------------|-------------| | **ATR** | **14.98** | Declining from 18.8 (late June) → **volatility compression** | Lower daily ranges imply a coiling action; expect an expansion move within 5–7 sessions. | | **Bollinger Band width** | ≈ 32.6 (2 × 20-day σ) | **Bands are pinching** – width at 2.5-year lows | Classic set-up for a volatility breakout; direction unknown from bands alone. |  ---  ### 4. Micro-Structure Observations (Last 10 sessions)  - **Volume profile**: Down-days on lower volume, up-days on higher volume → *slight accumulation bias*.   - **Support shelf**: 305.5–308.5 has been tested four times since 3-Jul and held on a closing basis.   - **Resistance cluster**: 322-325 area coincides with the declining 50-SMA and the mid-June gap (left 12-Jun). A close above 325 would open room to 340–345.  ---  ### 5. Tactical Scenarios & Probabilities  | Scenario | Trigger | Target / Stop | Odds (Subjective) | |----------|---------|----------------|-----------------| | **Range extension up** | Daily close > 325 with volume > 110 M shares | 340–345 (gap fill) / 310 | 35 % | | **Range extension down** | Daily close < 305 on heavy volume | 290–295 (volume node) / 325 | 40 % | | **Chop continuation** | ATR keeps shrinking, Bollinger Band width < 30 | 305–325 ping-pong | 25 % |  ---  ### 6. Indicator Selection Rationale  | Indicator | Purpose in this context | |-----------|-------------------------| | **close_10_ema** | Fast mean-reversion gauge; price vs 10-EMA gives intraday scalping edge. | | **close_50_sma** | Defines the *immediate* bear-bull line in the sand (≈ 320.8). | | **close_200_sma** | Macro anchor; price oscillates around it → confirms neutral regime. | | **macd** | Confirms momentum regime shift; histogram contraction suggests *seller exhaustion*. | | **macdh** | Early warning for momentum reversals; narrowing histogram = watch for zero-line test. | | **rsi** | Overbought/oversold flag; sub-45 bounce aligns with support test. | | **boll** | Middle band acts as *dynamic fair value*; price currently hugging it. | | **atr** | Position-sizing metric; falling ATR allows tighter stops without premature whipsaws. |  ---  ### 7. Summary Table  | Dimension | Current State | Forward Bias | |-----------|---------------|--------------| | **Trend** | Flat (200-SMA ≈ price) | Neutral → awaiting range resolution | | **Momentum** | MACD bear cross but histogram improving | Cautiously higher-probability bounce within range | | **Volatility** | Compressed (ATR & Bollinger pinch) | Expect expansion move within 1–2 weeks | | **RSI** | Mid-range (50.6) | Needs > 55 close for bullish confirmation | | **Support** | 305–308 | Critical for near-term bull case | | **Resistance** | 322–325 | Range ceiling for now |  ---  **Conclusion:** TSLA is coiling under the 50-SMA with momentum trying to turn higher from a deeply oversold bounce. Until either **325** or **305** gives way on a closing basis, treat the tape as a **high-volatility, low-directional-bias environment** best suited for short-dated option straddles or tight swing trades with quick risk management.

14:46:51 [Reasoning] # Tesla (TSLA) Weekly Macro & Trading Brief: July 8–15, 2025 *Current date: 2025-07-15*  ---  ## Executive Summary Tesla is at a critical inflection point.  The stock has dropped ~22 % YTD, is trading around $296–$310, and is surrounded by a swirl of binary catalysts: (1) Q2-25 earnings on 23-Jul, (2) accelerating market-share erosion in China, (3) political headline risk from both the Trump “One Big Beautiful Bill” and Elon Musk’s polarizing U.S. election involvement, (4) the official India launch on 15-Jul, and (5) a potential shareholder vote on investing in xAI.  Street sentiment is polarized: Goldman and JPMorgan are effectively “short,” while RBC and Cathie Wood are adding.  Options implied-vol is elevated into earnings.  The next 10–14 trading days will likely determine whether the stock re-tests the May low (~$270) or squeezes back toward the 200-dma (~$345).  ---  ## 1. Earnings & Guidance Risk (Q2-25, 23-Jul AMC) - **Deliveries already reported** 410 k units (-14 % YoY, inline with pre-announcement). - **Street EPS est.** $0.55–$0.60 (wide range; FactSet $0.58). - **Key focus items:**   - Automotive gross-margin ex-credits (street 16.8 % vs 18.7 % last year).   - Energy-storage deployments (Q2 record 9.6 GWh; watch margin trajectory).   - Full-Self-Driving take-rate and deferred-revenue release.   - Robotaxi timeline and regulatory pathway (Austin pilot live; Phoenix application submitted).   - China volume trajectory: weekly registration data has been soft (12.3 k in wk-28, down from 15–16 k in May). - **Post-earnings move (ATM straddle):** ~9 % vs 8-qtr avg of 7.4 %.  Skew is heavy to the downside.  ---  ## 2. China Market-Share Collapse - **Tesla China share** has fallen to **4 %** of EV market (vs 11 % in 2023). - **Weekly registrations** show BYD 48.8 k, Tesla 12.3 k, Xiaomi 6.7 k (wk-28). - **Price war:** Model Y Long-Range now CNY 263 k (incl. subsidy) vs Xiaomi YU7 at CNY 215 k with comparable range.  Margin compression evident. - **Policy tail-risk:** Chinese regulators continue to strip preferential treatment (registration-fee waivers, NEV credits) for foreign brands. - **Derivative impact:** Panasonic delaying full ramp at Kansas plant due to Tesla China volume weakness (Nikkei).  ---  ## 3. India Launch—Symbolic, Not Material (Yet) - **Showroom opens today** (15-Jul) at Mumbai’s Bandra-Kurla Complex. - **Pricing:** Model Y starts ₹6 million (~$70 k) – firmly luxury segment (<1 % of India’s car market). - **Regulations:** 100 % import duty on CBUs; no local plant approved yet (expected 2026–27). - **Competitive moat:** Against Tata, Mahindra, BYD (which is expanding Saudi footprint).  Near-term volume negligible (est. <2 k units in 2025).  ---  ## 4. Policy & Political Overhang (U.S.) - **Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBB)** eliminates federal EV mandates; could remove 45 kWh battery credits and cap-and-trade credits ($1.8 B revenue in 2024).  Bill passed the House last week; Senate vote in August recess. - **Carbon-credit crackdown:** EPA proposing stricter verification; Tesla’s high-margin credit business at risk. - **Canada frozen funds:** C$40 m aid package paused after Musk’s political tweets.  No material financial impact but reputational.  ---  ## 5. Street Sentiment & Flows - **Goldman Sachs** (Jul-11): PT cut to $285 (Neutral).  “Weaker U.S. EV demand.” - **JPMorgan** (Jul-09): Added to “Top Short” list for 2H-25. - **RBC** (Jul-09): PT raised to $350 (Outperform).  “AI-driven robotaxi S-curve.” - **Cathie Wood’s ARK** bought $18.5 m worth last week (largest single-day buy since May). - **Short interest:** 3.1 % of float (down from 3.4 % in June); still low vs history.  ---  ## 6. Technical Picture - **Price**: $295.88 close (Jul-09); pivotal support $285–$290 (May–Jul lows).  Resistance 50-dma $318, then 200-dma $345. - **Momentum**: RSI(14) 42.  MACD histogram narrowing; bear-flag risk on daily. - **Volatility**: VVIX ~125; weekly ATM straddle $28 (9 %).  ---  ## 7. Derivatives & Event Vol - **July-23 weekly expiry**: OI heavily skewed to $275 P and $320 C.  Straddle ~$28. - **August monthly expiry**: Put-call ratio 1.22 (highest since Jan). - **Dark-pool prints**: Large buyer at $297 (1.2 m shares, 10-Jul).  ---  ## 8. Trading Scenarios | Scenario | Probability | Price Target | Catalyst | |---|---|---|---| | Bull | 30 % | $340–$350 | Q2 margins beat + robotaxi update + India hype | | Base | 40 % | $290–$310 | Inline Q2, mixed guidance, macro noise | | Bear | 30 % | $250–$270 | Q2 miss, China price-war intensifies, OBBB passes Senate |  ---  ## 9. Key Calendar for Next Two Weeks - **Jul-15**: India showroom opening (today). - **Jul-23**: Q2-25 earnings AMC. - **Jul-24–25**: Conference call; potential xAI shareholder poll. - **Late-Jul**: Senate schedule on OBBB (watch for amendments).  ---  ## Key Data Table (Markdown)  | Factor | Current / Trend | Directional Bias | Trading Impact | |---|---|---|---| | Q2-25 EPS est. | $0.58 | Neutral | High | | China weekly registrations | 12.3 k (↓75 % YoY) | Bearish | High | | U.S. EV mandates | OBBB Bill | Bearish | Medium | | India showroom | Opens today | Neutral/Slight Bull | Low | | Goldman PT | $285 (↓) | Bearish | Medium | | RBC PT | $350 (↑) | Bullish | Medium | | Short interest | 3.1 % | Neutral | Low | | Implied earnings move | ±9 % | Vol Expensive | Options | | Technical support | $285–$290 | Critical | High | | Technical resistance | $318 / $345 | Key | High |  ---  **Bottom line:** TSLA is a binary play into earnings.  China headwinds and policy risk cap upside, while a modest beat + robotaxi narrative could trigger a violent short-covering move.  Position size accordingly—long gamma via ATM straddles or risk-reversals (sell $275 P, buy $340 C) balances range-bound risk/reward.  Watch the Senate calendar on OBBB; a delay or dilution would remove a major tail-risk.
