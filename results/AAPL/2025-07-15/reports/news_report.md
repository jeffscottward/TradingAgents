# Tesla (TSLA) Weekly Macro & Trading Brief: July 8–15, 2025
*Current date: 2025-07-15*

---

## Executive Summary
Tesla is at a critical inflection point.  The stock has dropped ~22 % YTD, is trading around $296–$310, and is surrounded by a swirl of binary catalysts: (1) Q2-25 earnings on 23-Jul, (2) accelerating market-share erosion in China, (3) political headline risk from both the Trump “One Big Beautiful Bill” and Elon Musk’s polarizing U.S. election involvement, (4) the official India launch on 15-Jul, and (5) a potential shareholder vote on investing in xAI.  Street sentiment is polarized: Goldman and JPMorgan are effectively “short,” while RBC and Cathie Wood are adding.  Options implied-vol is elevated into earnings.  The next 10–14 trading days will likely determine whether the stock re-tests the May low (~$270) or squeezes back toward the 200-dma (~$345).

## 1. Earnings & Guidance Risk (Q2-25, 23-Jul AMC)
- **Deliveries already reported** 410 k units (-14 % YoY, inline with pre-announcement).
- **Street EPS est.** $0.55–$0.60 (wide range; FactSet $0.58).
- **Key focus items:**
  - Automotive gross-margin ex-credits (street 16.8 % vs 18.7 % last year).

  - Full-Self-Driving take-rate and deferred-revenue release.

- **Post-earnings move (ATM straddle):** ~9 % vs 8-qtr avg of 7.4 %.  Skew is heavy to the downside.

## 2. China Market-Share Collapse
- **Tesla China share** has fallen to **4 %** of EV market (vs 11 % in 2023).
- **Weekly registrations** show BYD 48.8 k, Tesla 12.3 k, Xiaomi 6.7 k (wk-28).
- **Price war:** Model Y Long-Range now CNY 263 k (incl. subsidy) vs Xiaomi YU7 at CNY 215 k with comparable range.  Margin compression evident.
- **Policy tail-risk:** Chinese regulators continue to strip preferential treatment (registration-fee waivers, NEV credits) for foreign brands.
- **Derivative impact:** Panasonic delaying full ramp at Kansas plant due to Tesla China volume weakness (Nikkei).

## 3. India Launch—Symbolic, Not Material (Yet)
- **Showroom opens today** (15-Jul) at Mumbai’s Bandra-Kurla Complex.
- **Pricing:** Model Y starts ₹6 million (~$70 k) – firmly luxury segment (<1 % of India’s car market).
- **Regulations:** 100 % import duty on CBUs; no local plant approved yet (expected 2026–27).
- **Competitive moat:** Against Tata, Mahindra, BYD (which is expanding Saudi footprint).  Near-term volume negligible (est. <2 k units in 2025).

---

## 4. Policy & Political Overhang (U.S.)
- **Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBB)** eliminates federal EV mandates; could remove 45 kWh battery credits and cap-and-trade credits ($1.8 B revenue in 2024).  Bill passed the House last week; Senate vote in August recess.
- **Carbon-credit crackdown:** EPA proposing stricter verification; Tesla’s high-margin credit business at risk.
- **Canada frozen funds:** C$40 m aid package paused after Musk’s political tweets.  No material financial impact but reputational.

**Bottom line:** TSLA is a binary play into earnings.  China headwinds and policy risk cap upside, while a modest beat + robotaxi narrative could trigger a violent short-covering move.  Position size accordingly—long gamma via ATM straddles or risk-reversals (sell $275 P, buy $340 C) balances range-bound risk/reward.  Watch the Senate calendar on OBBB; a delay or dilution would remove a major tail-risk.
