Recommendation: SELL

================================================================
1.  Key Points From Each Camp (stripped to the chassis)

Risky / “Go Long”  
•  “Amazon analogy”: early-stage, high P/S is normal for disruptive tech.  
•  62 % revenue jump and 134 % reduction in losses show progress.  
•  Oversold technicals (weak RSI/MACD) present a “cheap” entry before a policy-driven rebound.  
•  Lower rates + U.S. on-shoring could unlock financing.

Safe / Conservative  
•  $136 m net loss, –$109 m free cash flow, and no firm customer contracts = severe liquidity risk.  
•  77× sales is not visionary, it’s an expectations time-bomb.  
•  Lost flagship Utah project proves regulatory approval ≠ commercial traction.  
•  Renewables already cheaper and bankable; utilities may skip SMRs altogether.  
•  Technicals remain in a confirmed down-trend; no base in sight.

Neutral  
•  Acknowledge huge TAM and carbon-neutral tailwinds, but timelines are long and cap-intensive.  
•  Wait for real de-risking events (binding contracts, capital raises that secure ≥18 mo. runway).  
•  Hedged or phased exposure is the only sane middle ground today.

2.  Why “SELL” Wins

Valuation vs. Cash Runway  
Quotes:  
- Safe: “$136 m net loss and 77× sales … a misstep collapses the multiple.”  
- Neutral: “We need evidence of de-risking … before relying on high-reward scenarios.”

Nothing in the Risky case refutes the core math: at the current burn rate NuScale will need fresh capital long before first revenue from an SMR. Dilution or expensive debt is almost guaranteed.

Execution Proof-Points Missing  
- The sole flagship project was cancelled; zero shovel-ready contracts remain.  
- Risky’s “Amazon” parallel ignores the nuclear sector’s multiyear, multi-regulator gauntlet.

Technical Confirmation  
Price sliced in half, lower highs/lower lows, bearish MACD/RSI—momentum traders are still sellers. Oversold does not equal bottom while fundamentals deteriorate.

Macro Backdrop  
Even if rates fall, recession risk usually suppresses large infrastructure starts; utilities delay cap-ex first, not last.

In short, bulls are paying venture-capital prices in a public-market vehicle—without the control or time horizon VCs enjoy.

3.  Refined Action Plan (evolves the trader’s original outline)

Step 1 – Exit Exposure  
•  Close any existing long within the next 5 trading sessions.  
•  Use staggered limit orders near intraday strength (±1 % of VWAP) to reduce slippage.

Step 2 – Optional Bearish Expression  
•  3–6 mo. $17.5 puts or a $17.5/$12.5 put spread sized <1 % of portfolio NAV.  
•  Hard stop: cover if daily close > $23 (recent resistance).

Step 3 – Re-Entry Filters  
Re-examine only after BOTH conditions are met:  
a) Signed, fully financed customer contract with construction start date.  
b) Post-deal cash runway ≥ 18 months without tapping equity markets.

Step 4 – Keep the Theme, Lose the Single-Name Risk  
•  Maintain clean-energy sleeve via diversified ETFs (ICLN, TAN) or profitable nuclear suppliers (Cameco, Brookfield Renewable).  
•  Allocate freed capital to names with positive cash flow and clearer demand visibility.

4.  Lesson Applied From Past Mistakes

Past error: “Let the big story trump the balance sheet.”  
Correction: Cash first, contracts second, narrative last.  
By enforcing hard pre-conditions for re-entry we avoid paying for optionality that may never turn into revenue.

================================================================
Bottom Line

NuScale is a promising story but an unproven business. Until it replaces narrative with funded projects and a solvency buffer, the prudent move is to step aside. Execute the SELL plan, keep nuclear exposure diversified, and revisit only when the de-risking checklist lights green.
