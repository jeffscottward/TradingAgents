Okay, team, here’s how the debate shakes out in plain English.

WHAT EACH SIDE SAID – CLAWS-OUT EDITION  

Bull’s best shots  
• NuScale sits in a “white space” – small modular reactors (SMRs) could become a core piece of the clean-energy mix.  
• Revenue just grew 62 %, and the net-loss rate is shrinking.  
• Its reactor design already has U.S. regulatory approval – a hurdle most nuclear start-ups never clear.  
• High P/S (77×) shows investors are willing to pay for that future optionality.  
• Falling interest rates should make financing easier for expensive, long-dated projects.

Bear’s strongest punches  
• Still deeply negative cash flow (-$109 m) and a $137 m net loss; no clear line-of-sight to profitability.  
• 77× sales is not confidence – it’s a massive expectations overhang. One misstep and the multiple collapses.  
• Renewables (solar/wind + storage) are cheaper, quicker, and already bankable; utilities may choose them over an unproven SMR.  
• Regulatory approval ≠ commercial acceptance. NuScale lost its flagship Utah project last year; demand proof is thin.  
• Technicals ugly: price halved from $32 to $18, negative MACD/RSI, high ATR – momentum is still down.  
• Macro: if growth slows or trade frictions rise, big-ticket infrastructure spending gets deferred.

WHO WINS AND WHY  
The bear.  The core of any early-stage energy story is cash runway versus time-to-market.  NuScale’s burn rate and sky-high valuation tell us the market is already pricing in flawless execution years before first cash flow.  History says nuclear projects rarely hit budgets or timelines, and cheap renewables keep resetting the bar.  Until the company lands a binding, financeable contract (with construction actually funded), the risk-reward skews negative.

MY RECOMMENDATION  
Sell / Avoid new longs.  Aggressive traders can express the view with puts or a small short, but exiting existing positions is the first step.

RATIONALE  
1. Valuation risk: 77× sales for a pre-revenue tech hardware company in a capital-intensive industry is unsustainable.  
2. Liquidity risk: current cash burn could force dilutive equity raises long before positive EBITDA.  
3. Execution risk: no utility has yet committed final investment dollars; one canceled order already.  
4. Technical confirmation: downward trend and weak momentum suggest no base is in place.

STRATEGIC ACTION PLAN  
1. If long, stagger exits over the next 5 trading days using limit orders near intraday strength to minimize slippage.  
2. Optional bearish play:  
   • Buy 3-to-6-month $17.5 puts (or a $17.5/$12.5 put spread) sized to < 1 % of portfolio NAV to cap risk.  
   • Set a stop if shares close above $23 (recent resistance) – respect the volatility.  
3. Re-enter only if NuScale secures (a) a fully funded customer contract and (b) demonstrates at least 18 months of cash runway.  
4. Maintain clean-energy exposure via broad ETFs (ICLN, TAN) or profitable nuclear incumbents (e.g., Cameco) to keep the thematic sleeve alive without NuScale’s single-name risk.

LESSON FROM PAST MISTAKES  
In earlier calls I’ve let “big-idea” narratives overshadow basic balance-sheet math.  This time the discipline is: cash first, contracts second, narrative last.  Sticking to that hierarchy keeps us from paying VC-style prices in a public-market vehicle.

Bottom line: the story is exciting, but our capital is better deployed elsewhere until NuScale proves it can turn regulatory approval into funded, profitable projects.
