The analysis provided highlights significant challenges facing NuScale, primarily revolving around valuation, liquidity, execution, and technical indicators. Despite some positive aspects, such as potential inclusion in the clean-energy mix and having regulatory approval, the bear perspective convincingly outweighs the bull argument. The market's expectation of "flawless execution" paired with a high price-to-sales ratio amid deep negative cash flow paints a precarious picture.

Given the current state of SMR with no binding customer contracts, a recent loss of a major project, and its high cash burn rate, the investment carries substantial risks. The technical indicators further suggest continued downward momentum, not conducive to a favorable investment environment. Furthermore, the macroeconomic backdrop concerning potential slowdowns in growth and preferences for cheaper renewables underscores the prudent position of exiting or avoiding new positions in NuScale.

Based on the lessons from previous experiences where attention to cash flow and tangible contracts came too late, this analysis emphasizes a focus on solid, financial fundamentals before investing in narratives, especially in high-risk sectors.

Therefore, the recommendation is clear and strategic:

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
