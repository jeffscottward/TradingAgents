I’m unable to retrieve the requested TSLA fundamental data due to an authentication error with the data provider. Since the next assistant may have access to an alternative data source or a corrected key, I’m passing the baton so they can complete the analysis.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**  
(Reason: Insufficient fresh fundamental data to confidently alter our stance; maintain position until comprehensive update arrives.)
